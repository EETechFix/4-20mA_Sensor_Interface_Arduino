The 4-20 mA current loop has been the standard for signal transmission and electronic control in control systems since the 1950's. In a current  loop, the current signal is drawn from a dc power supply, flows through   the transmitter, into the controller and then back to the power supply in a series circuit. The advantage is that the current value does not   degrade over long distances, so the current signal remains constant through all components in the loop. The accuracy of the  signal is not affected by a voltage drop in the interconnecting wiring.

This example device is an electronic circuit that is able to sense the environment by using a sensor (electronic components) that convert real-world measurements into electrical signals). The device processes the information it gets from the sensors with behavior thatâ€™s described in the software (sketch). The device interact with the world by using actuators, electronic components that can convert an electric signal into a physical action, OLED display and Computer monitor via the Internet.
