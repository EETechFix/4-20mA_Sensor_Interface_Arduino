This example device is an electronic circuit that can sense the environment using a sensor that converts real-world measurements into electrical signals. The device processes the information from the sensors with the behavior described in the software (sketch). The device then interacts with the world using actuators, electronic components that can convert an electric signal into physical action, an OLED display, and a Computer monitor via the Internet. 

The 4-20 mA current loop has been the standard for signal transmission and electronic control in control systems since the 1950s. In a current loop, the current signal is drawn from a dc power supply, flows through the transmitter, into the controller, and then back to the power supply in a series circuit. The advantage is that the current value does not degrade over long distances, so the current signal remains constant through all components in the loop. The accuracy of the signal is not affected by a voltage drop in the interconnecting wiring.
